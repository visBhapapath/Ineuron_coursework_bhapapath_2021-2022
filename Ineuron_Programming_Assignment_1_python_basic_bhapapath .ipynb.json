#1. Write a Python program to print "Hello Python"?
print("Hello Python")

#2. Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations addition and division?
# Add two numbers  
plus = 1 + 2  
# Subtract two numbers  
minus = 1 - 2  
# Multiply two numbers  
mul = 1 * 2  
#Divide two numbers  
div = 1 / 2  
print(plus)
print(minus)
print(mul)
print(div)

#3. Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle?
#Area of a triangle = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))-1/2
# Three sides of the triangle is a, b and c:  
a = 3
b = 4 
c = 2 
# calculate the semi-perimeter  
s = (a + b + c) / 2  
# calculate the area  
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5  
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)  

#4. Write a Python program to swap two variables?
# Two variables
x = 9
y = 80
# create a temporary variable and swap the values
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))

#5. Write a Python program to generate a random number?
#generating a random output number  is important inthe configuration and evaluation of machine learning algorithms

# seed the pseudorandom number generator
from random import seed
from random import random
# seed random number generator
seed(1)
# generate some random numbers
print(random(), random(), random())
